# BPSO_MKP
This repo contains a self-developed Low-level-Teamwork-Hybrid algorithm to solve the multidimensional knapsack problem. The global optimizer is the binary particle swarm optimization algorithm while local search acts as a local intensification operator. This LTH has been tested on small and medium size benchmark instances with a maximum number of variables of 100 and the number of constraints is less than 30.
