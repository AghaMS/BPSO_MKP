# BPSO_MKP
This repo contains a self-developed Low-level-Teamwork-Hybrid **LTH** algorithm to solve the **[multidimensional knapsack problem]** (https://towardsdatascience.com/the-binary-multidimensional-knapsack-problem-mkp-2559745f5fde).

The global optimizer is the **binary particle swarm optimization** algorithm while **local search** acts as a local intensification operator. 

This LTH has been tested on small and medium size benchmark instances with a maximum number of variables of 100 and the number of constraints is less than 30.
